# AutomationFramework

A **production-grade, generic AutomationFramework** for web UI, API, and database testing. Built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), this framework enables you to write powerful, maintainable, and readable tests using BDD Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then) for any project or organization.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
features/              # BDD feature files and step definitions
src/                   # Source code (page objects, utils, config, etc.)
tests/                 # (Optional) Playwright .spec.ts tests
logs/, screenshots/    # Artifacts captured on failure
allure-results/, html-report/ # Test reports
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Writing BDD Scenarios
- Write your scenarios in `.feature` files using Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then).
- Implement the logic for each step in `.ts` files under `features/step-definitions/`.
- Use tags like `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@api` for filtering and analytics.

---

## üêû Debugging & Troubleshooting
- **Debug mode:** Run with `DEBUG=true npm run bdd` for headed browser and slow motion.
- **Playwright Inspector:** Use Playwright‚Äôs built-in inspector for step-by-step debugging.
- **VSCode Debugger:** Set breakpoints in step definitions and use the "Run and Debug" panel.
- **Artifacts:** Check `logs/` and `screenshots/` for failure evidence.

---

## ü§ù Contributing & Extending
- The framework is designed to be **generic and extensible**.
- Add your own page objects, API clients, DB utilities, and custom step definitions as needed.
- For more details, see the `features/` directory and step definition files.

---

## üí° Why Use This Framework?
- **Generic:** No vendor or project lock-in. Use for any web, API, or DB automation.
- **Readable:** Write tests in plain English using Gherkin.
- **Powerful:** Leverage Playwright‚Äôs speed and reliability.
- **Maintainable:** Organize tests and logic for large projects.
- **Reporting:** Get beautiful, actionable reports with Allure and Cucumber HTML.
